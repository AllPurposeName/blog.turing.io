We’re talking with our students to learn a little bit more about how and why
they came to Turing, and why they want to be developers. We’d love for you to get
to know them, too. Meet Chad Brading.

**Susannah**: Tell me a little bit about yourself, Chad, and what you were doing
before you came to Turing.

**Chad**: Well, right before I came to Turing I was in a physics studies program
in Germany for about seven months. Before that I was working in Charlotte for an
investment banking company for about a year. That was my first job out of college.

**Susannah**: What motivated you to leave your studies in physics and pursue Turing?

**Chad**: The physics program was more theoretical than I wanted, so not something
I wanted to do long-term. This was similar in that I get to solve problems, but
it was more applicable than studying theories and textbooks all the time.

**Susannah**: Is there a reason that you chose Turing rather than a shorter bootcamp
 or another program?

**Chad**: I really like the length and the fact that was longer than others. I didn’t
 have much programming experience beforehand, so I really wanted to spend as much
 time as possible developing those skills. I didn’t really know what to expect coming
  in, but I’ve been learning as much as I anticipated I would. It’s actually been
  more enjoyable than I expected be, so that’s it nice surprise.

**Susannah**: Is there a particular aspect of the curriculum or one of the upcoming
 projects that you’re looking forward to?

**Chad**: I like getting into the bigger projects and just figuring out what to do.
You know, work through it from the ground up and come up with a strategy to solve
the problem.

**Susannah**: Do you have any plans post graduation or a sense for what kind of
work you’re most interested in doing when you leave Turing?

**Chad**: Not really I don’t really have any specific plans at this point. I’m
still kind of trying to figure that out.

**Susannah**: So how are you feeling at this point with your skill level? You
mentioned that you’ve learned some on your own. Now that you’re immersed in the
program, how are you feeling?

**Chad**: I wouldn’t say I’m feeling confident because I realize how much more
there is to go and how little I know right now, but I’m encouraged to keep going.
For sure.
