We’re talking with our students to learn a little bit more about how and why they
came to Turing, and why they want to be developers. We’d love for you to get to
know them, too. Meet Jonmichael Chambers.

**Susannah**: Tell us why you wanted to become a developer.

**Jonmichael**: It goes way back to when I was 8 or 9 years old. I was on AOL and someone had a little webpage they made with HTML that they were hosting and I thought, I want to make something like that, so I started learning. I’ve always been interested in programming. 

**Susannah**: What were you doing before Turing?

**Jonmichael**: Mainly just freelance web development off and on and taking some courses once in a while in computer science. I never felt I needed a college degree to do web development. 

**Susannah**: Given that you already had a technical background and some experience, what made you choose Turing?

**Jonmichael**: Location mainly. It was either Turing or gSchool, and Turing was more highly recommended. I started to pick up Ruby again last year, and even though I came into Turing with some experience, I figured I could learn more and pick up some best practices. The main appeal is that I can collaborate with people doing group work and pairing. I haven’t really done much of that before and it seems really valuable if I want to go to work for a company as a developer. 

**Susannah**: How are you handling the challenge of learning Ruby? 

**Jonmichael**: I’ve been focusing on collaborating with people, and I’ve been able to help others when they have questions because I’m comfortable with the learning curve right now. Sometimes I get stuck on the logic of how something works, and once I figure that out I can move forward. It hasn’t been too stressful. 

**Susannah**: What do you see yourself doing after you graduate from Turing? 

**Jonmichael**: I’d like to work on web applications. Rails has always been my passion, so my end goal is to work somewhere developing web applications.
