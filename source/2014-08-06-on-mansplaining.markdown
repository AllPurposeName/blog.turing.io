Last night we hosted our third [Community Night at Turing](http://www.meetup.com/Turing-Community-Events/). 

Community Nights are a way for us to create a safe space for people interested in or totally new to programming. Anyone from the community is welcome to come.

Each meeting one of our instructors teaches a workshop that shows off some of the *fun* in programming. Our first class I taught an intro to Ruby, the second Josh helped attendees get started with Arduinos, and last night Rachel taught an intro to jQuery.

But last night didn't go to plan. When you open your doors to anyone you risk
having people that don't know how we operate. They don't know how to fit in.

In tech that usually centers around ego. A lot of us have...let's say "healthy" egos. And some people don't know how to express that in a positive way. If you've ever been to a meetup where a member of the audience feels compelled to upstage the speaker, then you know what I'm talking about.

That happened here last night. I regret that I wasn't there to do anything about it in the moment. Many attendees told us that they enjoyed the session, but all of them expressed frustration with *"that guy"*.

That kind of behavior has no place here. I can't help but think that if I, a 6'3" man, were at the front of the room, these men would have been a little less likely to inject their opinion over and over and go so far as to push their way on to the presenter's computer.

I tracked the attendee down and delivered him this message (names redacted):

>(Attendee),
>
>I'd like to follow-up on last night's Community Night at Turing.
>
> This morning I've had multiple retellings of the evening, all of which expressed frustration with your and (Attendee 2)'s demeanor and behavior. While our community nights are an opportunity to bring new people together, it is not an open mic night. Your persistent redirection, second-guessing, and going so far as to take over Rachel's computer to show off something unrelated was unpleasant for attendees, for Rachel herself, and generally unwelcome.
>
> Community nights are about building a safe space for people new to programming. Your participation was a detriment to that effort. (Attendee 2) finishing the night by pointlessly explaining how he already knew everything covered in the session, which was itself described as an intro to jQuery, was an unpleasant end to an unpleasant evening.
>
> I regret that I wasn't there last night. I suspect that if I were the one teaching, the two of you would have been less likely to mansplain and grandstand. If Rachel were teaching and I observed your behavior, I would have (a) asked you once to stop then (b) asked you to leave then (c) had you removed.
>
> The most troubling part for me is that, likely, the two of you felt you were being helpful. You weren't. You were passive-aggressively trying to let everyone know how smart you are. No one was impressed and no one appreciated the effort.
>
> Please start your own gathering, demonstrate your intelligence there, and don't return to one of ours.
 
Building a positive, collaborative community or core to our mission, and there's no place for that kind of behavior here.
