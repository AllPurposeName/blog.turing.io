We’re talking with our students to learn a little bit more about how and why they
came to Turing, and why they want to be developers. We’d love for you to get to
know them, too. Meet Corey Davis.

**Susannah**: Corey, you were in the area already prior to coming to Turing, right?
Tell us a little more about why you wanted to become a developer and what you
were up to before coming to Turing.

**Corey**: Well before Turing I was a teacher. I taught eighth-grade science. I’ve
been teaching middle school for about six years, and honestly I’ve been searching
for something else.

Teaching wasn’t really where I had imagined myself. I ended up
there almost accidentally. It was a job and paid the bills, and I wasn’t really sure
what else I wanted to do. I didn’t really want to repeat that cycle of “oops how
did I end up here?” I wanted the next iteration of my career to be something very
purposeful and intentional.

I did a lot of searching for years. I parsed over all these different ideas,
jumped into this and that in a noncommittal way so I could figure out if it was
something I wanted to do long-term. I would find things that I thought I’d really
be interested in but, then as I got deeper into it for some reason or another either
my interest would fade or I’d decide it wasn’t really something I’m into. Or it
would be something that was such a spectacular level of change that really making
it happen realistically wasn’t probable.

When you’re in your 30s and you want to change your career, you can’t really go
back to a four-year college. That’s just kind of unrealistic. I also didn’t want
to take out some epic loan to try to start a business from the ground up, because
the risk was just too high.

So I put it out there to the world. I actually went on Facebook and just wrote a
post saying I don’t want to teach anymore, what the heck should I do with my life?
A good friend of mine who is actually a developer posted back and asked if I’d ever
tried programming. Then another friend of mine posted on gSchool. At that point
Turing didn’t exist. I thought, okay maybe I’ll check that out.

I was really into computers when I was a kid. I did some programming with Apple
basic, so I had some familiarity with it and it wasn’t like jumping off the deep
end without knowing anything. I started reading about gSchool, Ruby, and web
development. Then I got into some of the free resources and I picked up some books.

Then I met Brian Winterling, who was an alumni. He told me about Turing, which didn’t quite
exist yet it, so I looked into Turing and continued to learn a little bit more and
started to get into Ruby and rails.

The thing I started to notice was that I never got bored. I just kept wanting more.
That’s where I thought okay, this might be the thing, and I can do it in six months,
and I don’t have to take out a $200,000 loan to make it happen. And so all of
those pieces just sort of fell into place.

I think what cemented it for me was a big part of what I haven’t enjoyed in previous
careers — you get bored because it lacks a lot of the mental stimulation, or that
“I suck at this” vibe. I like feeling that because the bar is always just out of
reach and you’re never awesome at it, you’re always going to be struggling to improve.

That’s something that developing has offered me so it’s kept me really interested.

**Susannah**: So what sold you on Turing? Why Turing versus other schools out there?

**Corey**: I did look at some of the bootcamps in Colorado, and I decided those
wouldn’t cut it if I was going to switch careers. Maybe they’d work if I was just
interested in it and wanted exposure. I wanted a more serious program.

I applied to gSchool and Turing, got accepted to both, and it came down to a detailed
comparison of the program qualities. Being an educator myself, I had a lot of interest
in how education driven it is versus just some people who know a lot about coding but not
a lot about teaching. Through talking to gSchool and talking to Jeff I decided that
Turing met the education expectations that I had.

Ultimately, my decision to come to Turing had to do with the fact that it offers
a really educationally and pedagogically sound process. While other programs offer
an accelerated challenge, the education piece was missing.

**Susannah**: How are you handling the challenge of learning to code? Is it going
well for you?

**Corey**: When I’m able to back out and look at it with some perspective, it’s
going really well. When I’m in the moment, I tend to get a little frustrated. But
like I mentioned, I kind of got bored and haven’t ever really found anything that
was really hard for me.

With coding, I’ve been at it for three weeks and even though I’ve learned a ton
and I’ve gotten a lot better at it than I was, in the moment I still think I really
stink at this and I’m not good at coding. And so doing with that it’s just a
process of keeping your head game and always I think take the time to reflect on
your successes and each little baby steps you’ve made.

As far as dealing with it you just have to be ready for it. I thought I was ready
for it but there’s no way to really be ready for it or predict what it’s going to
be like. That’s cool. It’s would’ve caught me off guard and swept me off my feet
and that’s part of what’s kept my momentum going.

**Susannah**:What are your hopes post graduation where do you see yourself?

**Corey**: The more I learn about it I’m really hoping to find something that has remote options.
I guess originally I had imagined myself living and working with a little dev shop.
I didn’t know a lot about the industry outside of what I was just able to look up,
but I’m learning just how accessible the industry really is.

I think it would be cool to have a place where you can go to work face-to-face
with the team, but also an option to work remotely. Initially while I’m in that
newbie programmer state, I would like to work for a development company just to
work with some experienced people and get some exposure. Then ultimately I guess
it makes the world my oyster in the sense that I could get in with a startup or
I could do my own thing.

It’s such an expansive field and there are so many opportunities, so my idea of
what post-graduation looks like continues to evolve as I learn more.
