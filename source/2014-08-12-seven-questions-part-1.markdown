There have been several articles about developer training programs over the past few months in everything from small online tech papers to the [Wall Street Journal](http://www.infoworld.com/t/it-training/kaplan-and-dev-bootcamp-code-camps-hit-the-big-time-245087).

Two years ago, the vibe of articles about our little industry were "wow, this new thing is so exciting!" Lately they're a lot more skeptical, focusing on whether programs deliver on the promises they make and how programs stack up against one another.

Erin Carson wrote an [article for TechRepublic titled "How to pick a coding camp: 7 questions to ask"](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-pick-a-coding-camp-7-questions-to-ask/). The questions and commentary are interesting, and I'd like to contribute our perspective. I'll work through each of the questions/topics in a series of separate posts.

Throughout the series I'll make references and comparisons to other programs I know and respect such as [DevBootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/), [Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com/), and [MakerSquare](http://www.makersquare.com/).

### Question 1: How Intense Is It?

It's exciting to talk about the intensity of a program. Most people love the idea of "going all in" and working as hard as you possibly can. DevBootcamp students notoriously spend super long hours in the building throughout their nine weeks.

In designing [Hungry Academy](http://hungryacademy.com), gSchool, and now [Turing](http://turing.io), I spent a lot of time thinking about intensity. If we suppose that training the brain is like training a muscle, then going all-out every day over an extended period of time will only lead to injury. Maybe you
can get good value out of that approach for nine weeks, but it won't work for 27.

Do marathon runners run faster marathons than IronMan participants? I hope so. Does
that mean an IronMan marathon is less intense? No. It's just a different strategy
when you're attacking a different goal.

The only way to get reasonable value out of a short course (8-12 weeks) it to put
in a whole lot of hours. A program that short can't both value "work/life balance"
and deliver significant academic gains. But that's the right choice given the time constraint.

A training program isn't real life, it's a temporary arrangement. I like to tell
our students "work crazy hard now so you never *have to* again." Contrary to
popular mythology, good jobs aren't the ones where developers hack all night. They're
the ones where people are passionate enough that they *would* work seventy hour weeks,
but are *smart enough not to*. They cut themselves off at a reasonable time, thirsty to
return and attack problems in the morning.

So how *intense* should a program be? There's no
reason that a program should be intense for its own sake. The "intensity" is a
side effect of educational challenge. It's the feeling you get when you're
fighting.

The real questions you should ask are "what are the expectations for students?
Who sets and customizes those expectations? How much responsibility does the
instructional team and organization bear to guide my learning?"

If you're in a school your time should be *highly optimized and scheduled*. At
DBC they like to have more paired work and fewer whole-group classes. That
approach works for many learners and doesn't put as much instructional pressure
on your staff. At Turing we like to have more instructor-led sessions, lectures,
and workshops because we have the classroom experience to pull them off. Both
approaches are valid.

The important part is that there are **constant expectations** on student time and
learning. If a training program offers a lot of time to "work on your own projects"
or otherwise "guide your own learning", that's a red flag. You're not in a *school*,
you're paying tuition for office space. Some people learn well on their own, but
those people shouldn't pay tuition to a training program in the first place.

Break down the tuition by attendance hour. You'll probably arrive at something
like $25 per hour. Is the program really delivering that value when you're
just working on whatever comes to your mind? If the staff is just there to
answer questions, that's not education.

At Turing student time is **highly structured**. That doesn't mean you sit in a
classroom listening to someone talk all day. It means that every moment of our
day, every day of the week, every week of the program you have *something*
assigned that you're working on. Some of it's solo, most is in pairs or fours,
there are frequent full-group sessions, but one way or another there are **expectations
on your time**. Early on that work is prescribed in detail. As student expertise
grows they have more and more input in the direction and details of their work.

But the instructional team bears the responsibility of educating the student.
It's our job as educators to be the wind at your back, pushing
you the direction you need to go at just the right speed. To do any less would
break our promise to students: **[we'll turn you into a great developer](http://turing.io)**.
