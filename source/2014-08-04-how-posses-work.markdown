In our past programs we've used a 1-to-1 mentoring program where each student
was matched with an outside professional developer who volunteers their time.

When 1-to-1 works, it's *amazing*. We've had several students form such great
relationships with their mentor that they go to work with them after the
program. Our mentors are amazing and give students so much of their time and
expertise.

But 1-to-1 breaks down too easily. A student gets bogged down in their work and they lose touch. A mentor goes to a conference or has deadlines, and the
student feels abandoned. That sucks for everyone involved.

With Turing we have new opportunities. Because of the layered class approach,
starting a new group of students every seven weeks, we have diverse expertise
levels right here. In addition we have a growing pool of awesome alumni to bring into the system. We thus created the idea of posses. A posse is made up of:

* 3-4 current students, each at different stages of the program
* 2 alumni from past programs
* 2 outside professional developers

We've carved out 3:00-4:00pm MT weekly for the posses to get together, understanding that most mentors have to be working at that time.

Mentors volunteer their time so, of course, we understand that jobs, families, and other priorities come first. Each week, the ideal mentor:

* communicates with their posse a few times over email
* is available for 1-2 hours of async interaction (like reviewing student code on GitHub)
* is available for 1-2 hours of pairing or discussion/chatting (in person or remote)

To help with communication we've set each posse up with:

* a mailing list
* a Slack chatroom

When possible posse members like to meet in person, but many of our **most involved** mentors participate completely remotely over Google Hangouts and GitHub.

If you're interested in joining us as a mentor we'd love to have you. Shoot
an email to [contact@turing.io](mentoring@turing.io) and tell us a bit about yourself!
